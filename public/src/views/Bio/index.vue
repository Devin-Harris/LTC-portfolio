      I have always been an artist: as a child with her crayons and Prang 8-pan watercolor tray. 
      With colored pencils, and the paint-by-number kit I received one Christmastime 
      (never to finish, as the concept for me was too stiff). I was raised on art and art museum visits. 
      Finally, at some point as a teenager, I transitioned from the bored kid to the art fanatic 
      I am today, lingering over paintings, my family coaxing me to leave.

      I have a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from CCAD (Columbus College of Art & Design), 
      where I focused on painting and drawing. My preferred mediums are watercolor, oil, 
      charcoal and graphite. I particularly enjoy portraiture and still life painting, 
      and working from life (although I am able to translate from photographs as needed).

      I take inspiration from many diverse artists and genres from around the world, 
      with a particular focus on American Realism from the Hudson River School to the Gilded Age. 
      My favorite artists are too numerous to count. At the top of my list would include John Singer Sargent, 
      Cecilia Beaux, and N.C. Wyeth. It is my hope that in this digital information age, more attention 
      will be brought to all of the wonderful female artists who worked alongside their male friends, 
      family and colleagues, largely obscure outside their sphere.
